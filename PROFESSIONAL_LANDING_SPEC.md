# Professional SanzTech Landing Page - Implementation Guide

## ✅ What We Have vs What's Needed

### Current State:
- ✅ Modern WorkflowLanding page
- ✅ SEO optimized
- ✅ Mobile responsive
- ✅ Features showcase
- ✅ Demo button working

### What to Add:
1. ✅ **Pricing Section** - 3 tiers (Starter, Pro, Enterprise)
2. ✅ **Use Cases Cards** - For Affiliates, Businesses, Creators
3. ✅ **Proof Section** - Tech stack, compliance badges
4. ✅ **Better CTA** - Multiple conversion points
5. ✅ **Footer** - Complete with links

## 🎯 Quick Implementation Plan

Since the current WorkflowLanding is already good, I recommend:

**Option A: Enhance Current Page**
- Add pricing section
- Add use cases
- Add proof/trust badges
- Improve CTAs

**Option B: Create New Complete Page**
- Build from scratch with all sections
- Replace current landing

**Recommendation:** Option A - Enhance what we have!

The current page already has:
- ✅ Hero with demo button
- ✅ Features (6 cards)
- ✅ Capabilities
- ✅ Use cases (4 cards)
- ✅ CTA section
- ✅ Modern design

Just need to add:
- Pricing tiers
- Trust badges
- Better footer

Would you like me to:
1. Add pricing section to current page?
2. Add trust/proof badges?
3. Enhance footer with all links?

Or build complete new page from scratch?

Let me know and I'll implement! 🚀
